# Simple State Space Search

Implemented a C program for three search strategies: depth first, breadth first, and intelligent search for the solution to a Game of Fifteen set up. For intelligent search, I used the heuristic function and values f,g,h. The program uses a doubly linked list. The program is designed such that a search strategy is parameterized.
